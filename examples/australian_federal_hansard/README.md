# Hyperreal example: Australian Federal Government Hansard

This example shows an end-to-end example of working with data from the Australian Government's [Hansard](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard), which is the report of the proceedings of the Australian parliament and its committees. This example draws heavily on Tim Sherratt's [Glam Workbench](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/australian-commonwealth-hansard) materials, including both his data model and processing of the individual XML files, and his pre-prepared datafiles for 1901-2005.

(Also need to mention open Australia, and decide how to work with the more recent data - need better materials and links to other hansard things to)
